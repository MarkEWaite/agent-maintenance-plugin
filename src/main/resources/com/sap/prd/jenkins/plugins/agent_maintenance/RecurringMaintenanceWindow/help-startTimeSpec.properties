startTimeSpec=This field follows the syntax of cron (with minor differences). Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace:<br/>\
<pre>MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW</pre>\
  <ul>\
    <li>A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for "first-last". For the "day of the month" or "day of the week" fields, a question mark (?) may be used instead of an asterisk.</li>\
    <li>Ranges of numbers are expressed by two numbers separated with a hyphen (-). The specified range is inclusive.</li>\
    <li>Following a range (or *) with /n specifies the interval of the number''s value through the range.</li>\
    <li>English names can also be used for the "month" and "day of week" fields. Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case does not matter).</li>\
    <li>The "day of month" and "day of week" fields can contain a L-character, which stands for "last", and has a different meaning in each field:\
      <ul>\
        <li>In the "day of month" field, L stands for "the last day of the month". If followed by an negative offset (i.e. L-n), it means "nth-to-last day of the month". If followed by W (i.e. LW), it means "the last weekday of the month".</li>\
        <li>In the "day of week" field, dL or DDDL stands for "the last day of week d (or DDD) in the month".</li>\
      </ul>\
    <li>The "day of month" field can be nW, which stands for "the nearest weekday to day of the month n". If n falls on Saturday, this yields the Friday before it. If n falls on Sunday, this yields the Monday after, which also happens if n is 1 and falls on a Saturday (i.e. 1W stands for "the first weekday of the month").</li>\
    <li>The "day of week" field can be d#n (or DDD#n), which stands for "the n-th day of week d (or DDD) in the month".</li>\
  </ul> \
  The times will be in the time zone of the Jenkins controller JVM (currently <strong>{0}</strong>).<br/>
